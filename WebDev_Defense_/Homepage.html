            <p>
                Philippines has numerous numbers of kidnapping or rape cases in the year 2022. A lot of victims were
                minor or women.
                We should always appreciate life since it is the most valuable gift anyone could ever get. We must
                defend our lives from those who wish to harm us if we are to appreciate them.
                <br>
                This website intends to assist the community in eliminating or reducing kidnapping incidents by
                educating them or raising awareness to those people by learning some suitable self-defense techniques
                that they can train in and utilize in dangerous situations <br><br><br>

            <p>
                The Philippine National Police (PNP) said on Thursday that kidnapping instances from January through
                July this year were largely connected to POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator), although most of
                these have already been settled.
                
                According to PNP spokesperson Police Colonel Jean Fajardo, &quot;We have registered 25 occurrences of
                kidnapping episodes from January to July 2022, the majority of them were POGO-related.&quot;
